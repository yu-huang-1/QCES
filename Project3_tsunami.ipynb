Recall that Dedalus uses explicit timestepping for terms on the right hand side of the inputted equation.\n",

    "## 3. Shallow water equations on a sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the Earth isn't a flat plane. A great strength of Dedalus is its flexibility to solve equations in various geometries. The script below solves the 2D shallow water equations on a spherical shell, where the azimuth and colatitude are the independent variables. The colatitude is the complementary angle to the latitude such that the colatitude is $0^\\circ$ at the North Pole, $90^\\circ$ at the Equator, and $180^\\circ$ at the South Pole. The spherical geometry also allows us to take into account the Earth's rotation in a realistic way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will solve the following equations:\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t \\mathbf{u} + g \\nabla h + 2 \\Omega \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{u} = -\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} $$\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t + H \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla \\cdot (h \\mathbf{u}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $\\Omega$ is the Earth's angular velocity (in radians per second), and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is a unit vector aligned with the North Pole. Note that we have written the equations above in vector form. Dedalus includes vector calculus operators that make it very natural to solve equations like this without worrying about the particular form of the vector operators in a curvilinear coordinate system."
